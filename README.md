# README-Generator
  This project is licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

  ## Description
  The purpose of this app is to automate the creation of README files for users. After running the app using node, the reader is prompted to answer several questions which will then be stored and written into the README file. These are questions that pertain to the typical README structure and while any changes specific to the project will have to be manually added, this simplifies the process by helping users build the skeleton of their README.

  Useful information about coding, including tutorials and guides, as well as the starter code for this project, were provided by the UT Bootcamp GitLab: [https://git.bootcampcontent.com/University-of-Texas-at-Austin/UTA-VIRT-FSF-PT-05-2024-U-LOLC/].

  The MIT license badge and a guide to writing that code: [https://daily.dev/blog/github-markdown-badges-explained#how-to-add-badges-to-your-github-repository]

  I frequently referred to Mozilla's developer tool blogs (MDN Web Docs) for help identifying the correct code and syntax: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en].
